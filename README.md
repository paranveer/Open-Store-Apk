Open Store is a Flutter Android app (`com.simba.openstore`) that fetches APKs from your GitHub repository, shows install/update status, verifies integrity, and supports feedback + telemetry sync.

## Features

- Upgrade detection when repo version is newer
- Download with pause/resume/retry/redownload/delete APK
- App-level feedback flow with status updates (`Not looked`, `Looking`, `Done`, `NA`)
- Theme modes: system, light, dark
